        There is some evidence that the COVID-19 virus may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces. Approximately 2% - 10% of cases of confirmed COVID-19 disease presented with diarrhoea (2-4), and two studies detected COVID-19 viral RNA fragments in the faecal matter of COVID-19 patients (5,6).

<h2> What is Covid-19 ?</h2>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sn-12 col-nd-9 col-xl-10">

<p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.
Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>

<h2>How can i protect my child from Covid-19 infection?</h2>
<p2>Encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.</p2>
<div class="<main">
<br>
<br>
<ul1>
  <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.</li>
 <br>
  <li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<br>
  <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>
  <br>
  <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</li>
<br>
  <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, like tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles).</li>

<h3>Is children with special healthcare is at higher risk for Severe illness from COVID-19?</h3>
<P3>It is not known yet whether all children with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.<p3>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Who is at higher risk?</h3>
  <p4>COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</p4>
